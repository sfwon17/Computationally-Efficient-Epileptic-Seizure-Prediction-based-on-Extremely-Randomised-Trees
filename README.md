Computationally Efficient Epileptic Seizure Prediction based on Extremely Randomised Trees

The original code was taken from Areté Associates,2nd placed winner of 2016 Melbourne University AES-MathWorks-NIH Seizure Prediction Challenge.

* Features group underwent features selection process to extract useful features  
* Time needed to extract features was considered in features selection process
* Memory usage to extract features was considered in features selection process and model training.
