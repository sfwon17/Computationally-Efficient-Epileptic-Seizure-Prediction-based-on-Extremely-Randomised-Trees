Computationally Efficient Epileptic Seizure Prediction based on Extremely Randomised Trees

## Overview
The original code was taken from Areté Associates,2nd placed winner of 2016 Melbourne University AES-MathWorks-NIH Seizure Prediction Challenge. Codes used here are exactly the same as those of the original authors except some codes were commented out were used in the initial phase before feature selection process. Based on the codes and features extracted, Extensive work was focused on removing as much features as possible without affecting performances. The codes here represent the final features that were selected. Feature selection step was a tedious process where correlation between different groups were investigatd, grouped features selection process were used, as well as looking at the value of features importance generated by the trees. 

* Features group underwent features selection process to extract useful features  
* Time needed to extract features was considered in features selection process
* Memory usage (RAM) to extract features was considered in features selection process and model training.

## Results
* Slight improvement of AUC by 0.02
* Reduce time taken to run by 60%
* Reduce memory usage by half 

## Future work
* Finding out which channels of the signal is useful for the prediction.
* Look at features from other domain
* Combine data and apply neural network model if computaion resource is not an issue
